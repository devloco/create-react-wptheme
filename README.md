# Create React WP Theme <!-- omit in toc -->

Feb. 5, 2020
<br />
Facebook recently updated [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to [v3.3.1](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v3.3.1).

I usually give it a few days before updating this project to match... just to make sure they don't have any show-stopping bugs. But look for an update to `create-react-wptheme` this weekend-ish.

---

The intention of this project is to maintain a set of custom `react-scripts` that will allow you to
create React WordPress themes as easily as `create-react-app` allows other devs to create their apps.

The biggest difference with this project and the original is that **it uses your WordPress server as the
development server instead of the Webpack Dev Server.**

## Getting Started <!-- omit in toc -->

[Michael Soriano](https://github.com/michaelsoriano) is writing a tutorial for creating a theme using React. He uses `create-react-wptheme` for the initial setup. He provides a lot more detail than this `readme` and the screen shots are really helpful.

## Creating a New Theme

To create a WordPress theme using the `create-react-wptheme`, follow these steps.

-   Make sure your WordPress server is up and running.
-   Change dir into your WordPress themes folder (**this is just an example, use your real themes folder**).
    -   Windows: `cd C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes`
    -   Mac or \*nix: `cd /xampp/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/themes`
-   Use `npx create-react-wptheme` to make a new theme
    -   For example: (**replace "my_react_theme" with whatever you want your theme to be named**):
    -   `npx create-react-wptheme my_react_theme`
        -   If you want to use TypeScript, then the command would be:
        -   `npx create-react-wptheme my_react_theme --typescript`
-   When it finishes it'll tell you to change into your new theme's folder and run the Nodejs watcher (replace "my_react_theme" with the same name you used in the previous step):
    -   `cd my_react_theme/react-src`
    -   `npm run start`
-   That sets up the theme so that it can be seen in the WordPress admin area.
    -   **Go there now and set your WordPress site to use this theme.**
-   View the site in your browser with the new theme.
    -   **You must do this as it does some extra setup via PHP.**
    -   **If you get PHP errors, most likely your web server doesn't have write access to your theme.**
        -   Write access for your web server is only needed during this setup step.
        -   **You can revoke write access after the setup has completed.**
        -   Interested (paranoid?) about what it's doing? Check out the file: `<Your Theme's Root Folder>/index.php`
    -   When that's done you'll see: `Now, back in your command prompt, rerun the "start" script again...`
    -   To do that, go back to your command prompt where you first ran `npm run start` and rerun that same command again.
-   In a few seconds you should see your browser load with the standard create-react-app page, but it's running as a WordPress theme!

## Updating Existing Themes

When new versions of `Create React WP Theme` are released, you can easily upgrade an existing theme using a single command.

-   At a command prompt, navigate to your theme's `react-src` folder.
    -   e.g. `<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src`
-   If you use `npm` then run this command:
    -   `npm install @devloco/react-scripts-wptheme@latest`
-   If you use `yarn` then run this command:
    -   `yarn add @devloco/react-scripts-wptheme@latest`

### Updating TypeScript Types

If your theme uses TypeScript, you'll need to modify the theme's `react-app-env.d.ts` file:

-   Navigate to the `<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src/src` folder.
-   Open the `react-app-env.d.ts` file in your editor of choice.
-   Change the line in there to read (be sure to include the leading three slashes):
    -   `/// <reference types="@devloco/react-scripts-wptheme" />`
-   Save the change and you should be all set.

## Developing Your Theme

### React Tutorials

If you're looking at a React tutorial on the web, you can use `create-react-wptheme` in place of `create-react-app`.
<br>But you do have to remember that the React app code is one extra folder down inside your theme folder.
<br>Notice that the final folder in this path is `react-src`:

`/xampp/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src`

So for example, if the tutorial instructs you to edit the `src/App.js` file, then for you, that file would actually be located at:

`<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src/src/App.js`

### The Public Folder

The authors of the original `create-react-app` say that using the "Public" folder (found at `react-src/public` in your new theme's folder) is a last ditch "escape hatch" for adding otherwise-hard-to-deal-with files.

But for this project, I've decided to use it for all things that you'd put into a normal WordPress theme (e.g. functions.php, etc.). So any PHP, hard-coded CSS, and/or hard-coded JS (like other JS libraries that you'd like to reference globally (I don't judge)), can go into the public folder.

**In addition, any changes made to CSS, JS, and PHP files in the Public folder will cause a rebuild to happen.** Which is unlike `create-react-app` which ignores most of the files in the Public folder.

### Dev Configuration

After you've created a new theme, and all the setup is done, you'll find a file named `react-src/user.dev.json` that has some configuration options that you can mess with if you need to.

### HTTPS/SSL Support

If you develop using SSL (i.e. HTTPS), then you might want to run the `Browser Refresh Server` under SSL as well. Especially if you use Firefox, see here: [Firefox Websocket security issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11768221/firefox-websocket-security-issue).

To configure the `Browser Refresh Server` to use SSL, follow these steps:

-   These instructions use the command prompt.
-   Assuming you've already created a theme using `create-react-wptheme`, change directory into the `react-src` folder in your theme's folder
    -   Be sure to follow **all the instructions** under the **Usage** section at the top of this document. You need to complete the PHP portion of the setup before you can configure SSL.
    -   Windows example: `cd C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes\<Your Theme's Root Folder>\react-src`
    -   Mac or \*nix example: `cd /xampp/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src`
-   Create a new folder to hold you're development SSL certificate and key.
    -   All OSes: `mkdir ssl`
-   Change directory into the `ssl` folder
    -   All OSes `cd ssl`
-   Then create the SSL certificate and key.
    -   Windows: Install the [Linux Subsystem for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), then use the \*nix instructions below.
    -   Mac, see here: https://ksearch.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/generate-and-import-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-on-mac-osx-sierra/
    -   \*nix, see here (**also works with Linux Subsystem for Windows 10**): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl
-   Depending on which process you use to create the certificate and key, the files you created might have different extensions than those mentioned below.
    -   That's OK.
    -   Sometimes both files have a `.pem` extension, or each file has a different extension like `.crt` and `.key`.
    -   **Just be sure you know which file is the certificate and which is the key.**
-   There is a file named `user.dev.json` in the folder named `react-src` in your theme.
    -   Open that file in your favorite text editor.
    -   Change the "wpThemeServer" section to look like this (make sure it is proper JSON):
    -   `"wpThemeServer": { "enable": true, "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 8090, "sslCert": "ssl/localhost.crt", "sslKey": "ssl/localhost.key", "watchFile": "../index.php" },`
    -   **NOTE** the `sslCert` and `sslKey` items. **Make sure the values point to your SSL certificate and key files.**
    -   The paths to those files can be **full paths** or **relative paths** from the `react-src` folder (as shown above).
    -   I like to set the `host` to `127.0.0.1` instead of "localhost". Supposedly the numeric address gets special treatment at the OS level as being mostly safe.
-   Back in your command prompt, change dir back to the `react-src` folder.
    -   All OSes: `cd ..`
-   Start Node/Webpack JS watcher as you normally would:
    -   All OSes: `npm run start`
    -   Your theme should open in a new browser tab
-   If you need to add an SSL exception to your browser for your new certificate, there is a page running over HTTPS at the "host" and "port" you set in `user.dev.json` above.
    -   For example, if you're using host `127.0.0.1` and port `8090` as shown above, then open your browser to:
        -   https<nolink>://127.0.0.1:8090/
    -   From there you'll get the standard browser warning about self-signed certificates and get the option to add an exception.
    -   Once you've finished adding an exception to your browser, you'll need to refresh the tab with your development theme to force a reconnect to the `Browser Refresh Server`.

## Deploying Your Theme

While you're actively developing your theme, the files are not optimized for production. Before you put your theme into production, you need to run the `build` command.

Open a command prompt and change into the `react-src` folder of you theme and run this command:
`npm run build`

When that command finishes, your optimized files are located in a folder that can be deployed to your production server.

Here's an example showing which folder to deploy to your server:

-   ...wp-content
    -   themes
        -   my-theme
            -   my-theme `<- deploy this folder to your production server's themes folder`
            -   react-src
            -   !READY_TO_DEPLOY!.txt

If you need to continue developing your theme, simply:

-   `cd react-src`
-   `npm run start`

And all your theme files will reappear.

### Dealing With Differing Paths Between DEV and PROD

The `react-src/user.prod.json` configuration file is read when you run `npm run build`. The only option in there is setting the "homepage"
which controls the relative linking to files in your theme. The "homepage" setting in your main `package.json` file is used during development (and build by default).

During development, this is probably what you want. But **if you know your production server has a different root**, then you can set the homepage to be different during a production build.

For example:

-   Your WordPress dev server is running at http<nolink>://localhost/wordpress
    -   the homepage setting in your main package.json file will probably work just fine.
    -   The homepage line in your main package.json will be something like: `"homepage": "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>"`
-   But you know that your production server runs WordPress from the root: http<nolink>://mycoolblog.com/
    -   In this case you want to remove the `/wordpress` part, so set the "homepage" line in your `user.prod.json` file to:
        `"homepage": "/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>"`
    -   Then run `npm run build`
    -   **Note** at this point, **your theme will appear broken on your dev server**. But it should look as expected on your production server.

## Goals

-   Remove WebPackDevServer and use your WordPress dev server instead.
    -   Also, do not proxy the WordPress server.
    -   Thus removing CORS as a concern.
-   Maintain feature parity(ish) with `create-react-app`
-   Touch the original `react-scripts` as little as possible.
    -   Add new files where possible.
    -   This will make merges easier.
